<Idea/>

To provide an inteface to visualize energy consumption and contest information.

<Implementation/>

Created a web application to view contest information graphically using various kinds of charts.
Also, we have provided a dashboard to make it easy to visualize energy consumption data.

The data provided to us had to be processed before making it usable. There were some anomalies in 
the data as well some missing data points. So, our initial objective was to clean the data and 
load it in a format which can be used by the visualization tools.

Then we used this extracted data in the various graphs.

<Technologies used/>
